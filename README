Mathematical modelling of cancer invasion and metastasis


IBM SETUP: 

Individua are initially placed randomly on grid, multiple can be in one grid point. They represent cells.

They move according to random diffusion but their movement is biased due to matrix density differences.
Differences in ECM density occur due to ECM degradation by MDEs secreted by the individual cells (process for latter: see Kairomone method in grid.cpp).

Individua proliferate by mitosis: Double after a certain time. They die after a set life span.

We want to allow for random mutations to occur in the individua w.r.t. constant haptotactic coefficient PHI; DELTA_r, the constant rate of MDEs (m) produced by individua. Thus we want to represent MT1-MMP vs. MMP2: diffusive degradation using Kairomone method, degrade more quickly or secrete MDEs, which are rebound vs. local to individuum, slower degradation
